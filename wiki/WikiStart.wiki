#summary Google Summer of Code Knowledge Base Wiki

= Welcome to the GSoC Knowledge Base Wiki =

We've started this wiki to provide helpful advice for prospective and accepted Google Summer of Code^TM^ mentors and students, mostly composed by former mentors and students. Google's program administrators have also contributed to the wiki based on feedback we've received throughout the program's history.

Remember, this wiki is meant to provide guidance *only*.  What works well for one project may not work well for another, and each student's approach to the program will be unique. Further, each mentoring organization will need to create its own guidelines for participating in the program.  We hope the information provided on the wiki will be a useful starting point in drafting these guidelines, and we [mailto:gsoc@google.com welcome your feedback] about additional information that would be helpful.

==Advice for Mentors==
Wondering how to choose the best applicants for your project?  How to deal with a student reticent to post questions to the project-wide mailing list? How to keep your project's students engaged with the community long past the program's conclusion?  

Check out the AdviceforMentors page.

==Advice for Students==
Not sure how to choose the best mentoring organization for you? How to write an effective application?  How to approach dealing with your (perhaps super-famous) mentor?

Check out the AdviceforStudents page.

==More Help==
Interested in another perspective?  Have other topics you'd like to discuss?  We've created two private mailing lists, one for all program mentors and one for students.  See the [http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code/ Project Home Page] for a full list of all program mailing lists.

The purpose of these lists is to give all program participants a place to communicate and seek advice from peers about any issues that may arise during the course of the program.  They are purposely closed so that this peer communication remains private and no one posting to these lists has to be concerned that any questions or discussions harm the relationship between mentor and student.
