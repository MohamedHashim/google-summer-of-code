#summary Google Summer of Code(tm) Program Wiki

= Welcome to the GSoC Program Wiki =

We've started this wiki to provide helpful advice for prospective and accepted GSoC mentors and students, mostly composed by former mentors and students. Google's program administrators have also contributed to the wiki based on feedback we've received throughout the program's history.

Remember, this wiki is meant to provide guidance *only*.  What works well for one project may not work well for another, and each mentoring organization will need to create its own guidelines for participating in the program.  We hope the information provided on the wiki will be a useful starting point in drafting these guidelines, and we [mailto:gsoc@google.com welcome your feedback] about additional information that would be helpful.

==Advice for Mentors==
Wondering how to choose the best applicants for your project?  How to deal with a student reticent to post questions to the project-wide mailing list? How to keep your project's students engaged with the community long past the program's conclusion?  

Check out the AdviceforMentors page.

==Advice for Students==
Not sure how to choose the best mentoring organization for you? How to write an effective application?  How to approach dealing with your (perhaps super-famous) mentor?
