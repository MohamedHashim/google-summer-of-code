#summary Flyers to Advertise the Google Summer of Code Program

= Advertising Google Summer of Code 2007 =

Each year, we've created an English language flyer and asked the community to help us advertise the program by papering their local campuses and student watering holes.

This year, our community members have generously provided us with translations of the program flyer in various languages.  Some organizations have created their own flyers to advertise the program.

== How You Can Help ==
  * Translate the program flyer.  You can send the translated text via email to our [mailto:gsoc@google.com support alias] or place it in a [http://docs.google.com Google Doc] shared with [mailto:lhospo@gmail.com Leslie Hawthorn] and [mailto:tlkgospo@gmail.com Tiffany Griffith].  We'll send you a PDF copy of the translated flyer to post on your site, then we'll link to it from this page.
  * Create your own GSoC promotional materials and tell us about it.  We'll link to them from this page.

All these flyers are available as PDF only.
