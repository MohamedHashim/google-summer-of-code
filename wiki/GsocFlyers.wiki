#Flyers to Advertise the Google Summer of Code Program

= Advertising Google Summer of Code 2007 =

Each year, we've created an English language flyer and asked the community to help us advertise the program by papering their local campuses and student watering holes.

This year, one of our students asked if he could translate the flyer for us, and we're hoping more GSoCers follow suit.  All flyers are linked to below are PDF.
