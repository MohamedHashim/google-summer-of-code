===Angie Byron - Drupal===
I got my start, both in the [http://drupal.org/ Drupal] project and as an open source developer, when I was a student during GSoC 2005. I am now completely immersed in the Drupal project, working full-time as a [http://lullabot.com Lullabot], and get to help with pretty much everything, including creating and testing core patches, documentation, user support, developing contributed modules, training, and even creating the odd graphic here and there.

GSoC has completely transformed my life, and I'm eager to help make 2007 a rousing success so that others may experience this as well. :)

===Leslie Hawthorn - Google, Inc.===
2007 will be my second GSoC.  :)

I held various roles at Google before joining the Open Source Program Office in March 2006, and I co-managed the Google Summer of Code program for 2006 along with cdibona & gstein.

In addition to all things GSoC, I host open source community conferences and hackathons at Google, usually at our [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1600+Amphitheatre+Pky,+Mountain+View,+CA+94043&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=37.422833,-122.085056&spn=0.018132,0.042057&t=k&om=1&iwloc=addr corporate headquarters]. I'm proud to be known as [http://www.flickr.com/photos/41128780@N00/296375336 Google's geek herder].

I am a [http://lullabot.com Lullabot] by day, and a [http://drupal.org/user/5449 Drupal contributor], well, by day, by night, and all the rest of the time. I co-authored the [http://www.amazon.com/Building-Online-Communities-Drupal-WordPress/dp/1590595629/sr=8-3/qid=1171291491/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/002-0249664-7274410?ie=UTF8&s=books very first book about Drupal], and am a technical review for [http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Drupal-Development-John-VanDyk/dp/1590597559/sr=8-2/qid=1171291491/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/002-0249664-7274410?ie=UTF8&s=books another book], soon to be published.

Along the way I've seen how well the Summer of Code concept works, and want to share my experiences and any tips I have with others so that they get the most out of the program.
