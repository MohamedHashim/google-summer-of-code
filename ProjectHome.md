### About Google Summer of Code(tm) ###
_Google Summer of Code_ is a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects. We work with many open source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund projects over a three month period. Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together over 7,500 successful student participants from 97 countries and over 7,000 mentors from over 100 countries worldwide to produce over 50 million lines of code. Through Google Summer of Code, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic pursuits. In turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers. Best of all, more source code is created and released for the use and benefit of all. The program, which kicked off in [2005](http://code.google.com/soc/2005/), is now in its tenth year, following on from a very successful [2006](http://code.google.com/soc/2006/), [2007](http://code.google.com/soc/2007/), [2008](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/), [2009](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2009), [2010](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2010), [2011](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011), [2012](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012), and [2013](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013).

### Program Goals ###
The program has several goals:
  * get more open source code created and released for the benefit of all
  * inspire young developers to begin participating in open source development
  * help open source projects identify and bring in new developers/committers
  * provide students in Computer Science and related fields the opportunity to do work related to their academic pursuits during the summer (think 'flip bits, not burgers')
  * give students more exposure to real-world software development scenarios (e.g., distributed development, software licensing questions, mailing list etiquett
